\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Evangelos A. Yfantis for hiring me as an undergraduate and introducing me to the types of problems that neural networks can solve as well as the tools to solve those problems. 

I especially want to thank Dr. Jan B. Pedersen for making me perform countless hours of MPI and Java thread programming, as well as Scheme which motivated the wise decision to choose Clojure for this project.
