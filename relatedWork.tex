\section{Training Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithms}
A number of projects have used genetic algorithms to train neural
networks.

\cite{montana} used genetic algorithms to train a neural network for
the problem of classifying sonar images.
Their approach was to use a genetic algorithm instead of
backpropagation to train the weights for a neural network.
The chromosomes are the weights of the network encoded as a list of
real numbers.
Special operators are used for adapting the weights.
Their results show that they were able to get better training results
using a genetic algorithm for training when compared to standard
backpropagation.
