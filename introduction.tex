\section{Introduction}
Certain problems lend themselves toward solutions that are probabilistic in nature and not always deterministic. 
Artificital Neural Networks are one way to solve problems of this nature. From a high level, a Neural Network is a black
box that given an input pattern, produces an output pattern that is the network's best guess to be correct. 
It essentially estimates a function whose domain is the set of all input patterns and range is the set of all output patterns.

This program hopes to mitigate the problem of choosing a network structure by using a search algorithm similar to a genetic algorithm to determine a good structure for a network.
