\section{Introduction}
Certain problems lend themselves toward solutions that are probabilistic in nature and not always deterministic. 
Artificital Neural Networks are one way to solve problems of this nature. From a high level, a Neural Network is a black
box that given an input pattern, produces an output pattern that is the network's best guess to be correct. 
It essentially estimates a function whose domain is the set of all input patterns and range is the set of all output patterns.


The neural network architectures that are generated and bred are all single or multi-layer back propagation networks.  A single network will be generated by presenting the application with a training set, then a test data set that is disjoint from the training set will be used to test the accuracy of the network.  A number of problems will be used to test the network.  With every problem set, we hope to generate a network that is capable of correctly mapping the test data set with a high degree of accuracy.  At the very least we hope that networks of later generations will be more accurate than networks of previous generations so that with each new generation the networks get better at solving the problem.
