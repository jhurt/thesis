\chapter[XOR Results]{XOR Results}
The test problem that was used while building the application is a simple XOR problem. The input/output map is provided to the program as the following: 

%#Scheme
%[
(def XOR-table {[-1 -1] [-1]
                [-1 1] [1]
                [1 -1] [1]
                [1 1] [-1]})
%]

The networks are trained with random samples from the map.

local iMac
8 nodes
3 hidden layers
50 max nodes per layer
3000 training cycles
16 generations
16 slaves
