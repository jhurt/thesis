\section{Architecture}
The software uses a distributed master-slave architecture where each slave is a trainer and the master is the implementor of the genetic algorithm. The master starts by generating a number of random neural network structures based on upper bounds given by the user. It pushes each of these structures to a message queue that the slaves on the network consume messages from one at a time. Each slave uses trains the neural network structure starting with random weights and the neural network structure it consumed from the queue. Upon finishing training, each slave places a training result in a separate message queue for the master to consume. This message contains the network structure, the weight matrice, and the error percentage of a neural network. The master uses these messages to perform reproduction, crossover, and mutation operations to the networks structures to create a new population of structures for the slaves to train. The process continues in this manner until a certain number of generations have been bred. 

The neural network structures that are generated and bred are all single or multi-layer back propagation networks.  A single network will be generated by presenting the application with a training set, then a test data set that is disjoint from the training set will be used to test the accuracy of the network.  A number of problems will be used to test the network.  With every problem set, we hope to generate a network that is capable of correctly mapping the test data set with a high degree of accuracy.  At the very least we hope that networks of later generations will be more accurate than networks of previous generations so that with each new generation the networks get better at solving the problem.

The algorithm begins by generating a set of neural networks with random structures and giving each slave a network to train.  Each slaves trains the network starting with a random weight selection and a fixed training set common to all slaves. The master gathers the results of the training at each stage and applies genetic algorithm-like crossover and mutation operations to a the architectures of the fittest of the networks.  The new generation are the children of these "fit" parents which are then distributed to the slaves, and the algorithm continues in this manner until a specified number of generations has been created.  The fittest network of the last generation is selected as the network most capable of solving the particular problem.
