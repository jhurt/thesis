\section{Genetic Algorithms}
Genetic algorithms are search algorithms that attempt to find a generally good solution to a problem whose search space
is very large and therefore computationally inefficient to compute through enumeration or whose functions are discontinuous and cannot
be solved with methods requiring finding the derivative at points in the space.
